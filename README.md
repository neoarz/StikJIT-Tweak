# StikJIT Dylib

A dylib tweak made for each JIT access when injected into an .ipa. It uses the StikJIT url scheme (stikjit://enable-jit?bundle-id=(bundle_id)) in order to easily enable JIT for apps.


You must have StikJIT installed.

Tweak is derived from these two projects:

- [StephenDev0/StikJIT](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT)
- [jkcoxson/idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice)
